Revision of existing data model for DraCor - description/disclaimer

On behalf of @lehkost, I am reviewing the data model for the DraCor project, which has been operating successfully for many years. Numerous countries have contributed their national drama corpora. https://dracor.org/
A new release of the schema/ODD applicable to all drama corpora was last published in July 2025. https://github.com/dracor-org/dracor-schema

In the issues posted here, I discuss from an outsider's perspective striking aspects, in randomly selected dramas and the ODD, including documentation. I compare them with the current TEI standard and, where possible, also document on solutions found in the DTA.

This is intended to provide the project with information on where the current TEI standard may take a different approach, where there are other best practice solutions, and thus serve as a basis for discussion within the project. 
I am currently unable to judge which of these proposed changes are sensible, necessary, or feasible. In some cases, I am also not yet aware of the reasons behind certain markup decisions. 
These are all just suggestions and questions, not actual criticism of the solutions that have already been found and proven to work well.
